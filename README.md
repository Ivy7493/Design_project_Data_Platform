- Note: The app is basic and may not include all features discussed under design.

## **Development:**

Node.js is used for a web server in conjunction with the Express framework. Socket.io is used for communication.


## **Project management:**

Under the project tab of the Git repo, there is a project titled *To Do*, this shows tasks as well as a basic scrum handling of the development process. Sprint 0 was a skeletal development of the app on which features could be added as desired by the development team. For all artifacts of these meetings and project progression, look under the docs file in the repository. Due to the fact that this is a design phase, the developers are aware that a project may be handled slightly differently in implementation as the documentation shows, but as previously mentioned, the main purpose was to provide proof of concept of design.
